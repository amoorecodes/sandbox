Apache is multithreaded === single task gets its own thread.
Node is singlethreaded / asynchronous === no blocking. 
It can do more than one thing at a time.
All events are put in the que (stack) and are served in order. 

Node has global object as a top level object. It has a handful of methods (including console, for example).

console.log('something') === global.console.log('something')

It works similar to browser but is not the same. 

Variables are scoped in Node, they are not stored in Global object. They can be accessed as is. 

When you run node command you can leave out .js in file, as it is assumed the file would be .js .
